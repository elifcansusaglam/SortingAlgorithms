# Insertion Sort Example

[22,27,16,2,18,6] =>According to Insertion Sort Algorithm :

[(22,27),16,2,18,6]

[(16,22,27),2,18,6]

[(2,16,22,27),18,6]

[(2,16,18,22,27),6]

[(2,6,16,18,22,27)]

### Time Complexity

Worst Case : n^2

Best Case : n 

Average Case : n^2

Big-O Notation: 0(n^2)

* 18 is average case

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] => According to Insertion Sort Algorithm :

[(3,7),5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

[(3,5,7),8,2,9,4,15,6]

[(3,5,7,8),2,9,4,15,6]

[(2,3,5,7,8,)9,4,15,6]
